    <div class="para1" >socills and economic backwardness are the consequences of lack of education. Lack of womenâ€™s empowerment, caste-ism, alcohol and drug abuse, violence and intolerance as also incidents like rape are issues that plague a society which does not have access to universal education. Similarly, poverty, malnutrition and poor health care are related to lack of education.
